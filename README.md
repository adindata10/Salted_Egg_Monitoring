Final Project - Indobot Academy - IoT Engineer Camp - SIB#3 Kampus Merdeka
Salted Egg Monitoring by. SIB3-Transistor D Team

This tools will monitor maturity level of salted eggs through the salinity of the solution, ripening room's temperature and humidity, and also ripening duration.
However, for this tools to have maximum performance, it is best to use microcontroller for each of the sensor or using external power supply for microcontroller.
